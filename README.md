<h2> 🔸 Description : </h2>

This project is a DIY Smart Solar Power Bank designed to provide a sustainable, portable, and user-friendly power source for charging phones and USB-powered devices. The system operates using solar energy, stored in rechargeable 18650 batteries, and includes a battery level indicator and a built-in flashlight for added utility.

The power bank uses two 18650 lithium-ion batteries connected in parallel to increase capacity while maintaining a stable 3.7V output. These batteries are connected to a Dual USB 5V 2.4A Micro/Type-C USB Power Bank 18650 Charging Module with IP5407 IC charging module with battery protection, which serves as the central component for charging and discharging the system.

The solar panel is connected to a DC-DC Boost-Buck Converter to reduce its voltage to a safe 5V before feeding it into the Charging module  from Micro-USB input and 

<h3> 🔸 To improve usability:</h3>

A charge level indicator (1S module) displays the battery status when the user presses a dedicated push button.

An LED flashlight is integrated and can be turned on/off using another push button, making it perfect for outdoor or emergency use.

Two USB output ports allow the user to charge two devices simultaneously.

The entire circuit is housed inside a compact casing, making it ideal for everyday carry, travel, or emergencies.
